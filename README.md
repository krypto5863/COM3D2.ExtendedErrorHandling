# COM3D2.ExtendedErrorHandling
A compilation of error fixes and handling that prevent the game from crashing or being stupid when encountering harmless errors.

# Implemented So Far
- ErrorTexturePlaceholder
- CCFix
- Loading a maid with a missing face or body will no longer cause a flood of errors that cause a crash.
- Having a CategoryCreator or corrupt preset will no longer cause the preset panel to fail to open in Edit Mode.
- Loading a menu file with a missing model file will no longer cause a crash or a looping error message.

More as I encounter them.
